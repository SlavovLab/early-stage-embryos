Pre-patterning of the embryo, driven by spatially localized factors, is a common feature across several non-mammalian species1–4. However, mammals display regulative development and thus it was thought that blastomeres of the embryo do not show such pre-patterning, contributing randomly to the three lineages of the blastocyst: the epiblast, primitive endoderm and trophectoderm that will generate the new organism, the yolk sac and placenta respectively 4–6. Unexpectedly, early blastomeres of mouse and human embryos have been reported to have distinct developmental fates, potential and heterogeneous abundance of certain transcripts7–12. Nevertheless, the extent of the earliest intra-embryo differences remains unclear and controversial. Here, by utilizing multiplexed and label-free single-cell proteomics by mass-spectrometry13, we show that 2-cell mouse and human embryos contain an alpha and a beta blastomere as defined by differential abundance of hundreds of proteins exhibiting strong functional enrichment for protein synthesis, transport, and degradation. Such asymmetrically distributed proteins include Gps1 and Nedd8, depletion or overexpression of which in one blastomere of the 2-cell embryo impacts lineage segregation. These protein asymmetries increase at 4-cell stage. Intriguingly, halved mouse zygotes display asymmetric protein abundance that resembles alpha and beta blastomeres, suggesting differential proteome localization already within zygotes. We find that beta blastomeres give rise to a blastocyst with a higher proportion of epiblast cells than alpha blastomeres and that vegetal blastomeres, which are known to have a reduced developmental potential, are more likely to be alpha. Human 2-cell blastomeres also partition into two clusters sharing strong concordance with clusters found in mouse, in terms of differentially abundant proteins and functional enrichment. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of intra-zygotic and inter-blastomere proteomic asymmetry in mammals that has a role in lineage segregation.
